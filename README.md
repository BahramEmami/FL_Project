# ðŸ§  Regular Grammar to DFA Converter (with Operations)

This Java project converts **regular grammars** to **deterministic finite automata (DFA)** and performs classic automata operations such as **complement**, **union**, and **intersection**. It reads input from a structured text file and writes formatted output to another text file.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Convert a Regular Grammar to NFA, then to DFA
- Support for:
  - **Complement**
  - **Union**
  - **Intersection**
- Trims unreachable states in the DFA
- Renames states to human-readable format (e.g., `S`, `A`, `B`, ...)
- Writes output to a clean, formatted `output.txt` file
